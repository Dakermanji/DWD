I began my coding journey with online courses on platforms like Udemy and edX, and have since earned three diplomas in web programming from Concordia University.",

In the evenings, I channel my creativity and skills into freelancing projects. I love solving complex problems and creating seamless user experiences. Let's build something amazing together!"
